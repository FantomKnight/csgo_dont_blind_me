# csgo_dont_blind_me

This app reduces the monitor brightness when you get flashed in CS:GO.

You need be on the Windows platform and have a DDC/CI-compatible monitor. You most likely meet these requirements.

If you use the [prebuilt binary](https://github.com/dev7355608/csgo_dont_blind_me/releases), you don't need to install anything else. If don't want you run the prebuilt binaries,  you would obviously have to have Python 3 and Flask installed in order to get up and running.

Finally, copy *gamestate_integration_dont_blind_me.cfg* into

 - *...\\Steam\\userdata\\{12345678}\\730\\local\\cfg*, or
 - *...\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo\\cfg*.

Then then run the app and launch CS:GO. Done!
